# Paradigmatic Integrable Systems

A *paradigmatic integrable system* is a model that serves as a classic and well-understood example of an integrable system, allowing researchers to study and exemplify key properties of integrability. These models are defined by the existence of a sufficient number of conserved quantities (or *first integrals*), which enables their exact solvability and distinguishes them from chaotic systems.

## Key Concepts of Integrable Systems

### Integrability

In classical mechanics, an \(n\)-degree-of-freedom system is integrable (specifically, *Liouville integrable*) if it possesses \(n\) independent, conserved quantities that are *in involution*, meaning their Poisson brackets vanish:

\[
\{I_i, I_j\} = 0 \quad \text{for all } i, j.
\]

In quantum mechanics, integrability is often defined by the existence of a complete set of *commuting conserved quantities*.

### Exact Solvability

Due to their conserved quantities, the dynamics of integrable systems can be solved exactly. In classical systems, this often reduces to solving integrals (quadratures). In quantum systems, techniques like the *Bethe ansatz* are frequently employed.

### Non-Chaotic Behavior

Integrable systems are the opposite of chaotic systems. While chaotic systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions, the motion of integrable systems is constrained to lower-dimensional surfaces in phase space.

## Examples of Paradigmatic Integrable Systems

### Classical Systems

- **Toda Lattice**: A one-dimensional chain of particles with exponentially decaying interactions between nearest neighbors. It exhibits *soliton* solutions—solitary waves that maintain their shape over time.

- **Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) Equation**: A nonlinear PDE describing shallow water waves. This infinite-dimensional integrable system is also known for soliton solutions.
