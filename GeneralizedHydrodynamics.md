# 1. Hamiltonian Systems and the Toda Lattice

## 1.1 Overview of Hamiltonian Mechanics

Hamiltonian mechanics is a reformulation of classical mechanics based on energy functions and symplectic geometry. A system is described by:

- A set of **generalized coordinates** \( q_i \) and **conjugate momenta** \( p_i \)
- A **Hamiltonian function** \( H(q, p) \), typically representing total energy
- **Hamilton's equations of motion**:
  \[
  \dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}, \quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}
  \]

These equations preserve the symplectic structure of phase space and are foundational in both classical and quantum dynamics.

## 1.2 The Toda Lattice as a Hamiltonian System

The **Toda lattice** is a paradigmatic example of a Hamiltonian system, describing a one-dimensional chain of particles with nonlinear, exponential nearest-neighbor interactions.

### Hamiltonian Form

The Hamiltonian of the classical Toda lattice is:
\[
H = \sum_{n} \left( \frac{p_n^2}{2} + e^{-(q_{n+1} - q_n)} \right)
\]
Here:
- \( q_n \): position of the \( n \)-th particle
- \( p_n \): momentum conjugate to \( q_n \)

### Equations of Motion

From Hamilton’s equations, the time evolution is:
\[
\dot{q}_n = p_n, \quad
\dot{p}_n = e^{-(q_n - q_{n-1})} - e^{-(q_{n+1} - q_n)}
\]

These define a chain of interacting particles governed by nearest-neighbor forces.

## 1.3 Integrability and Soliton Solutions

The Toda lattice is **completely integrable**, meaning it has as many conserved quantities as degrees of freedom. This allows for:
- Soliton solutions: stable, localized wave packets
- Lax pair formulation: a matrix representation \( \dot{L} = [P, L] \) preserving the spectrum of \( L \)
- Change of variables (Flaschka variables) simplifying analysis:
  \[
  a_n = \frac{1}{2} e^{-(q_{n+1} - q_n)/2}, \quad b_n = -\frac{1}{2} p_n
  \]

This leads to a hierarchy of commuting flows and integrals of motion.

# 2. Generalized Hydrodynamics and the Toda Lattice

## 2.1 What is Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD)?

**Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD)** is a modern theoretical framework developed to describe the large-scale (Euler-scale) dynamics of **integrable systems**, which possess infinitely many conservation laws.

GHD generalizes traditional hydrodynamics by incorporating a **continuum of conserved quantities**, such as quasi-particle modes. It describes these through a **root density function** \( \rho(x, \theta, t) \), where \( \theta \) parametrizes rapidity (momentum-like variables from the integrable structure).

The central equation of GHD is:
\[
\partial_t \rho(x, \theta, t) + \partial_x \left( v^\text{eff}(\theta, \rho) \cdot \rho(x, \theta, t) \right) = 0
\]
where \( v^\text{eff} \) is the effective velocity of excitations, depending on \( \rho \) itself due to interactions.

## 2.2 Hamiltonian Structure of GHD

GHD can be formulated as a **Hamiltonian field theory**:
- Define functionals \( \mathcal{F}[\rho] \) over the root density
- Introduce a **Poisson bracket** structure:
  \[
  \{ \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G} \} = \int dx \int d\theta \, \rho(x, \theta, t) \left( \frac{\delta \mathcal{F}}{\delta \rho} \partial_x \frac{\delta \mathcal{G}}{\delta \rho} - \frac{\delta \mathcal{G}}{\delta \rho} \partial_x \frac{\delta \mathcal{F}}{\delta \rho} \right)
  \]
- The Hamiltonian is typically the **total energy functional**:
  \[
  \mathcal{H}[\rho] = \int dx \int d\theta \, \epsilon(\theta) \rho(x, \theta, t)
  \]
- Hamilton’s equations then yield the GHD evolution equation.

This structure applies to both classical and quantum integrable systems, and can be extended to include external forces, interactions, and inhomogeneities.

## 2.3 Application of GHD to the Toda Lattice

The Toda lattice is a classical integrable system to which GHD has been successfully applied. Key results include:

### 2.3.1 Gas and Chain Pictures

Two complementary descriptions are used:
- **Gas picture**: particles moving in continuous space
- **Chain picture**: particles fixed on a lattice with interactions

Both can be described using GHD by defining appropriate spectral densities and effective velocities.

### 2.3.2 Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA)

Using the classical TBA, one can derive:
- The **generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE)** for equilibrium
- The **effective velocity** \( v^\text{eff}(\theta) \)
- Hydrodynamic equations in GHD form

### 2.3.3 Correlation Dynamics and Transport

Linearized GHD has been used to:
- Compute **space-time correlation functions**
- Analyze **ballistic transport** and dynamical structure factors
- Derive exact results for spreading of perturbations in the Toda lattice

These results are consistent with and extend known results from soliton theory and numerical studies.
